## OpenGL Experimentation

A collection of OpenGL animations. Some of which were built as part of a university coursework

## Rotating Square

* A colourful rotating square that can be sped up using left click and slowed down / reversed using right click
* It uses a custom reshape function to keep it in proportion instead of stretching and is locked using a timing function to 60fps
* It would be more efficient if I enumerated all 360 angles into a display list first, but it's a simple program so it doesn't matter

## Rotating Cube

* Rotates a color cube with black edges at a fixed 60fps
* Left, middle and right clicking changes the axis to rotate on
* Pressing 'q' quits the application
* Resizing the window maintains aspect ratio
* Makes use to OpenGL's vertex and color arrays for more efficient rendering

# Sine Cosine

* Demonstration of a nice animation using the sine and cosine functions

# Sierpinski Gasket

* Renders the Sierpinski Gasket in 2D.
* Uses the random vertex method of generation.

# Primitives

* Renders different shape primitives depending on which key is pressed
